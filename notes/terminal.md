# Terminal
Terminal (Windows PowerShell) is used to execute code.
## Write and Execute Python Code in Terminal
Open Terminal > type `python` and press enter
1) Type `"Hello World"` and press enter. Hello World will be printed. **Inside the terminal, you don't need to pass things through the print function to print.**
2) Type `(1+4)*5` and press enter. 25 will be printed.

The above method is not practical as it requires us to code inside the terminal. The preferred method is to create a separate Python file and execute the code in that file. That's where a IDE (code editor) like VS Code or PyCharm comes into play.

After writing code in IDE, you either run it inside the IDE or the Windows Terminal application.
## Terminal Application Method
First of all, access the folder where the Python file is located in order to run it.
### Commands
- `>cd (Directory Name)` — opens the mentioned directory
- `>cd..` — move back one directory
- `>ls` — show contents in the current directory
- `>python (File Name).py` — executes the mentioned Python file
#### Example
`\Documents\Hello_World >python main.py`
