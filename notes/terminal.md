# Windows Terminal
Terminal (Windows PowerShell) is used to execute code.
## Write and Execute Python Code in Terminal
Open Terminal > type 'python' and press enter
1) Type `"Hello World"` and press enter. Hello World will be printed. **Inside the terminal, you don't need to pass things through the print function to print.**
2) Type `(1+4)*5` and press enter. 25 will be printed.

The above method is not practical as it requires us to code inside the terminal. The preferred method is to create a separate Python file and execute the code in that file. That's where a IDE (code editor) like VS Code or PyCharm comes into play.
