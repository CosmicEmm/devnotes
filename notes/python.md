# Python
## Introduction
* It is a multi-purpose programming language and is very helpful is automating repetitive tasks.
* A code editor (IDE) is needed to run Python code and PyCharm is one of the best ones available.
* Python is a case-sensitive language.
## Applications of Python
* Data Science
* Machine Learning
* Web Development (Python + Django Framework)
## Websites Powered by Python
* YouTube
* Instagram
* Spotify
* Dropbox
* Pinterest
## Terminal Window
It displays the output of the Python program when we run it.
## Python Data Types
### String
* It represents a sequence of characters or textual data.
* It is always enclosed in single quotes or double quotes.
### Boolean
* It can be True or False.
## Inbuilt Python Functions
### Print
It prints the data within the parenthesis on the terminal window.
```py
print("Hello World")
```
> **Terminal:** Hello World
## Variables
Variables are used to temporarily store data  in a computer's memory.
```py
age = 20
print(age)
```
> **Terminal:** 20

Here age is the variable and 20 is the value that's assigned to it.
```py
age = 20
age = 30
print(age)
```
> **Terminal:** 30

**Imp: Python code gets executed from top to bottom.**

When using multiple words in the name of a variable, separate them with an underscore for better readibility.
```py
unit_price = 19.95
```
We can also assign a string value or a boolean to a variable.
```py
first_name = "Levi"
is_online = True
```
## Exercise
We check in a patient named John Smith. He's 20 years old. He's a new patient.
### Solution
```py
patient_name = "John Smith"
age = 20
status = "new"
print(patient_name, age, status)
```
> **Terminal:** John Smith, 20, new
